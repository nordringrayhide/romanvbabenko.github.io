<p>It’s not an article at all. Just some emotional intro for <a href="http://programmingisterrible.com/post/139222674273/write-code-that-is-easy-to-delete-not-easy-to">Write code that is easy to delete, not easy to extend</a>.</p>

<p>It’s pleasure to meet people who follow the same things like you and you don’t have to rewrite pieces of experience over and over again. I don’t recommend to read the article to people who are a “copy-a-paste” hater or a dogma evangelist. It’s for the men flexible enough to get that all decline questions start with “it depends on” and don’t follow development practices blindly as the only rules.</p>

<p>This world is not perfect. Your code is not perfect as well and it’s disappointing. But I believe that “perfect code” differentiates from “working code” just like “karate kata in dojo” and “street fight”. Of course, we wanna fight as we were taught by our teachers and clever books, but there’s not the time to think, no time to get a better position, no space to strike stronger. We must fight and win. So the same we have with coding. OOP, best practices, KISS, YAGNI, patterns, reusable code are “kata” of us, but code “easy to delete” is a good extension of our experience for real fighting against complexity.</p>

<p>That’s all.</p>
